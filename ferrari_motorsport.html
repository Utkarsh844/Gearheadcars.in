<p><font face="Arial">Scuderia Ferrari was born after Enzo Ferrari,
himself a driver, set up a team to run the works Alfa Romeo race team.
After some successful years Alfa took the team in-house and Enzo decided to do better himself with his own cars.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Due to legal constraints he was not allowed to build cars bearing the Ferrari name for some time, thus the birth of the 
AAC815.
The first car to bear his name first ran in March 1947 and was
christened the 125 Sport, the number representing the cubic capacity of
one cylinder. The resulting 1.5-litre V12 powered car won seven races
in its debut year, including the Rome GP on 25th May where it was
driven by Cortese.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">In 1948 it continued to win, and was
joined by a new F2 car. With a slightly larger engine, and thus known
as the 166, it included the Mille Miglia and Targa Florio in its
victory count for that year. In the following year the same car, albeit
with various bodies, again won the Mille Miglia and Targa Florio, and
added the prestigious Le Mans 24 hours to its cups.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">1949 also saw the debut of a new
supercharged, single-seat F1 car, the 125 F1. This won two Grand Prix
(Italy and Switzerland) but in the following year the supercharging was
dropped and work concentrated on naturally aspirated versions. The 1950
Mille Miglia was won by a 195S.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Success returned to the F1 team in
1951 when they took three victories, as well as the Mille Miglia being
won by a 340 America. 1952 was even more successful with Ascari taking
the F1 drivers championship, helped by seven race wins. The Mille
Miglia was again won by a Ferrari, this time a 250GT MM whilst the
World Sportscar Makes Championship was also won by Ferrari, mainly
using the new four cylinder 500 car.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Both the F1 drivers and Sportscar
Makes championships were won again in 1953. Ascari took the former,
whilst wins in the Mille Miglia (340MM), Le Mans 24 hours (375MM) and
1000km Nurburgring (375MM) helped with the latter. The makes title was
won again in 1954 using various 375 cars (including Le Mans, 1000km of
Buenos Aires and Carrera Panamerica) but F1 was less successful with
only two wins.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The latter half of the 1950s saw
various cars with a wide range of 4, 6, 8 &amp; 12 cylinder engines
being built and successes being achieved all over the world in various
categories. The F1 drivers championship was won in 1956 and 58 and the
Makes championship in 1956, 57 and 58. The Mille Miglia was won in 1956
and 57, the Sebring 12 hours in 1956, 58 and 59, the Le Mans 24 hours
in 1958 the Targa Florio also in 1958. Many other races were also won
in these most successful years.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\f312_1968.jpg" alt="Ferrari 312, F1 car of 1968" width="457" align="right" border="1" height="200">The
victories continued into the 1960s, with Sportscar titles in 1960, 61,
62, 63, 64, 65 and 67. These were first dominated by the various 250
cars, including the 250GTO,
then by the larger capacity 275 cars and finally by the purpose built
330 P2, P3 and P4 cars. A few wins each year in F1 continued to go to
Ferrari, and indeed in 1961 and 1964 they won both the drivers and
constructors titles. The drivers were Phil Hill in 1961 and John
Surtees in 1964 driving the 156 and 158 respectively.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Sportscars continued into the 1970s
with the totally unbeatable 312PB. Introduced in 1971, 1972 was really
its year, when it won every race it entered (including the 1000km races
at Buenos Aires, Brands Hatch, Monza, Spa, Nurburgring and Austria, the
6 hour races at Daytona and Watkins Glen, the 9 hours at Kyalami, the
12 hours at Sebring and the Targa Florio) and predictably also took the
title. It continued part way into 1973 but then stopped abruptly as
Ferrari withdrew from sportscars. A half-hearted return was first made
in 1994 with the 333SP which achieved limited success.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Returning to the 1970s and in F1
Ferrari took three drivers and four constructors titles (1975 with
Lauda, 1976 constructors only, 1977 with Lauda and 1979 with
Scheckter). They managed the constructors title again in 1982 and 1983,
but for the drivers title had to wait a long time until more recently
in 1999 Schumacher ended the drought. This has been followed by
consecutive years of domination yet to end........
