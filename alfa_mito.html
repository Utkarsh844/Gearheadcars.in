Early 2008 saw the first images of the long awaited spiritual successor to the being revealed online. A compact, highly entertaining to 
drive, hatchback, the MiTo takes styling cues from the  whilst using a modified version of the 
Fiat Grande Punto</a> chassis. 

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The first car to be designed after the
8C, the MiTo carries several of the characteristic features of that
car, especially the side windows, the nose with its central grille and
two lower side intakes, and the circular LED rear lights. A compact
car, just over 4m in length, this has been used as an advantage in that
it allows a very rigid chassis to be constructed, with an exceptional
torsional stiffness of 101200daNm/rad. Aerodynamically, the significant
amount of theoretical and wind-tunnel work has paid off, with an
excellent Cd of just 0.29.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">In terms of <b>engines</b>, the MiTo
at launch (depending on market) offers a choice of five. Using petrol
there is a naturally aspirated 78bhp 1.4 8v engine, a 16v version with
95bhp and a turbocharged 16v version of the same with 155bhp. The
diesel options are a 1.3 16v MultiJet with 90bhp and the latest 1.6
JTDm common-rail turbodiesel with 120bhp and 320Nm of torque. All
engines drive through manual six-speed transmissions.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\mito002.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo Mi.To" align="left" border="1" height="220" width="293">
An interesting feature of MiTo is the so-called <b>DNA system</b>.
This is an advanced, switchable form of dynamic control system with
three selectable modes. The 'Normal' mode is intended for relaxed,
urban driving; 'Dynamic' is optimised for sports driving, and 'All
Weather' ensures full control of the car in low-grip conditions.
When a mode is selected, the Alfa DNA System adapts all aspects of the
car and indicates the choice that&#8217;s been made with three
different-coloured LEDs and a signal on the control panel. The DNA
system acts on the steering wheel, on the VDC/braking system and on the
engine management systm. It changes their response, sensitivity and
performance, signaling each change on the instrument panel.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The Normal mode is ideal for getting
around the city and for relaxed, everyday driving. In this set up the
individual components in the Alfa DNA System are configured normally.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The Dynamic mode is optimised for
sportier driving, and offers a very different driving experience due to
the fact that the DNA makes the VDC and the ASR less intrusive,
partially freeing up the MiTo from electronic control of the vehicle
dynamics. At the same time it activates the Electronic Q2, the
electronic LSD software ar the front. This mode also acts on the
steering and the engine, the steering becomes less power-assisted to
give a sportier feeling while the throttle becomes more responsive and
the 155bhp petrol and 120bhp JTDM diesel engines can also draw on
over-boost.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\mito2.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo Mi.To" align="right" border="1" height="220" width="443">When
All Weather is chosen on the DNA selector, the car is set up so that it
guarantees the driver the maximum control over the vehicle, even in
low-grip conditions, such as on the wet or snow. When this is
activated, the Alfa DNA System makes the car more easily controlled
even on low-grip surfaces by acting on the vehicle&#8217;s dynamic control
and lowering the VDC intervention threshold. </font></p><p><font face="Arial">In terms of <b>safety</b>, the Mi.To
has been designed to be one of the safest cars in Europe, and its
safety features have also been 'future proofed'. At the end of 2008 the
current Euro NCAP crash test ratings &#8211; which certify car safety - are
changing, and the Mi.To has been designed to score as highly as
possible under the new system.
The Alfa MiTo comes with seven airbags as standard, a double
pre-tensioner on the front seatbelts, an anti-whiplash device on the
seats, a collapsible steering wheel in case of head-on collisions, and
SBR (Seat Belt Reminder) technology.
This last feature comprises five sensors on a small screen on the
windscreen which detect whether all the passenger belts - both front
and rear - are fastened. The system is extremely rigorous and sends out
an acoustic signal should any of the passengers not have fastened their
belt.
The Alfa Mi.To promises maximum safety both for passengers and for
pedestrians. This result has been achieved by designing the bumpers so
they can pass rigorous tests and also by optimizing the exterior
components in order to avoid any possible injury to pedestrians&#8217; legs. </font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\mito001.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo Mi.To" align="left" border="1" height="220" width="332">
Internally, the MiTo was designed by Centro Stile and is heavily
focussed around the driving position, with carefully positioned seat,
steering wheel, pedals and instruments. The atmosphere is typically
Alfa Romeo with a selection of styles available, mostly red or black
(there is also on blue) and heavily featuring finishes which reflect
the sporty aspirations of the brand, such as titanium, carbon-fibre and
leather. The sporty instruments are illuminated in either red or white,
depending on the version. The standard car is a four-seater (although
the 5th seat is an option in some markets). To ensure interior comfort,
a dual-zone automatic climate control system is available, as are
heated seats and a BOSE sound system.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">With regard to <b>telematics</b>, the
Fiat Group has been pushing ahead, and the MiTo offers all its options
- Blue&amp;Me (hands-free phone and USB port for MP3 music players),
Blue&amp;Me Nav (which adds a pictogramme navigation system using the
instrument panel display) and Blue&amp;Me Map (which uses a dashtop
mounted removable colour display). All come with voice control, whilst
Blue&amp;Me Nav also offers SOS and INFO services via roof mounted
button which call a central callcentre.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The range depends upon each market,
but the fundamental factory produced options at launch consisted of two
trim levels each with its own dashboard and seat trims, plus two
special packs which offer additional seat trims. </font></p>
