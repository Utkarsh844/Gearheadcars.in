<p><font face="Arial">Born in 1898, between the wars Enzo Ferrari
first drove for and then ran the racing team for Alfa Romeo. In 1939 he
founded his own company at Modena, but it was late 1946 before the first
Ferrari car, the 125S, was to emerge. This began competing in May 1947,
and scored its first victory later that month. It was powered by a Colombo
designed 1498cc V12, later growing to 1903cc (in the Tipo 159) and then
1995cc (Tipo 166) to follow the changing regulations for Formula 2.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The first Formula One car appeared in 1948
with a supercharged version of the 1500cc engine. With its magnesium block
and using 1.6 bar of boost it generated 225bhp @ 7,000rpm.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">All the first car were racing cars, and
it was not until 1948 that the first road cars began to be produced, the
initial model being the 166 Sport. Other variants of the 166 included the
Inter and Mille Miglia, and 92 type 166 cars were built up until 1953.
As was normal in those days, the bodies were built by a variety of Italian
coachbuilders, including Touring, Vignale, Ghia and Farina. The engines
also varied, from 90bhp to 155bhp, and the wheelbases from 2160mm to 2620mm.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">In 1951 the engine was bored to give a
total displacement 2341cc, with the car becoming the 195 to reflect the
change. Around 25 examples were built until later that year it was replaced
by the 212 with a 2563cc engine (140bhp with one carburetor, 170bhp with
three). This model was built up until 1953 on short (2250mm) and long (2600mm)
wheelbases, the total production being about 80 cars.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Returning to 1950, the lack of success
with the supercharged 1500 led to the decision to build an eqivalent normally
aspirated unit, which under F1 rules could be up to 4.5-litres. This new
V12 was designed by Lampredi and initially appeared with a capacity of 3322cc.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The first road car with the Lampredi V12
was the 340 America (4102cc with 220bhp) introduced at the Paris motorshow
in 1950. As usual bodies came from various sources including Ghia, Touring,
Pinin Farina and Vignale. Shortly afterwards the 340 Mexico replaced the
America and through different carburettors (three 40DCFs) and a higher
compression ratio (8:1) produced 280bhp. A significant loss in weight also
helped improve the performance.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Until 1964 all the road cars were powered
by either the Colombo or Lampredi V12 engine monted at the front and driving
a live rear axle. The bodies continued to be designed and built by various
coachbuilders until about 1960 by which time Pininfarina had become the
standard designer and Scaglietti the preferred constructor.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The 1960s saw the first mid-engined Ferrari,
albeit with a Dino badge, and the emergence of independent rear suspension.
In 1969 Fiat purchased 50% of the company, the remainder being purchased
in 1988 after Enzo passed away.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">By the 1980s Ferrari had changed to the
opposite extreme, producing only mid-engined cars, but under Fiat the front
mounted V12 driving the rear wheels came back to join that layout.</font>
