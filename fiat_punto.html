<b><font color="red" face="Arial" size="+3">Fiat Punto (1999 on)</font></b>

<p><img src="logo\punto188_004xx.jpg" alt="Fiat Punto" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="337"><font face="Arial">The
'Nuova Punto' was introduced on the 100th anniversary of the Fiat company
in the summer of 1999. Although actually a mid-life update of the old Punto,
most of the car is new (80% of parts are new), including an all new exterior
design and new rear
suspension (torsion beam). Class leading interior space and passive
safety (the car received an excellent four stars in the Euro NCAP test) were praised by the press.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Available with three or five doors, and
a range of engines comprsing 1242cc 8V with 60bhp, 1242cc 16V with 80bhp,
1910cc diesel with 60bhp,1910cc JTD diesel with 85bhp (previously 80bhp) and at the top,
the 1747cc 16V with 130bhp. This latter unit is the same as that in the
Barchetta and Coupé.
A special mention is deserved by the Sporting, which uses the 1.2 16v
engine coupled to a six-speed manual gearbox. This model also features
a stiffer suspension and an aggressive bodykit, and really follows the
character of sportier small Fiats, being a genuine 'put a smile on your
face car' without being seriously fast.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\punto188_008xx.jpg" alt="Fiat Punto" align="left" border="1" height="200" width="343">
The three and five door cars are slightly differently styled, the five door
having a more aggressive appearance especially from the front. All cars
come with a drivers airbag and options include passenger and side airbags (standard in some markets).
Other new features are theelectronic
power steering (with two levels of assistance selectable by the driver) and 'follow-me-home' headlights
which stay on for a predetermined time after you lock the car. The HGT
also features as standard a satellite navigation system, ABS and traction control.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Transmissions include a five speed manual,
a six speed manual and a CVT Speedgear.
This latter can be used in the fully automatic mode, or as a sequential
shift, with either six or seven preset ratios (depending on model).
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\npunto1.jpg" alt="Revised 2003 Fiat Punto 3-door" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="309">The
Punto has proved to be a popular car and its mass appeal has led it to
being the best-selling car in Europe for some years, whilst in early
2003 the 5,000,000th Punto was produced (including the earlier
version).
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">In May 2003 a heavily revised Punto
was released, the third incarnation of the best-selling car.
Significant changes to the appearance were joined by new engines and
content. </font></p><p><font face="Arial">The whole front end is new,
including the bonnet, lights, bumper, wings grill etc, whilst at the
rear the bumper changed and some other detail changes made including
the adoption of the round Fiat badge and additional reflectors on the
three door car. Whereas the previous car had differentiated between
three and five door versions visually (with different front and rear
bumpers), the new car features a front end which is different for the
sportier versions, the Sound (or Active Sport) Sporting and HGT, with
all the other (both three and five door) using the same bumpers.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\punto_fl02.jpg" alt="Revised Fiat Punto 2003 5-door" align="left" border="1" height="200" width="270">Under
the bonnet the same 1.2 8v (60bhp) and 16v (80bhp) engines together
with the 1.8 16v (130bhp) and 1.9 JTD (85bhp) continue, but they are
joined by three new units. A 1.4-litre development of the FIRE engine
with 95bhp is now available (fitted to the new Sporting version), and a
1.9 MultiJet JTD with 100bhp is also offered, derived from the earlier
engine. Completely new is the award winning 1.3 16v MultiJet with
70bhp, claimed to be the smallest, most compact diesel, incorporating
all the latest technology such as common-rail, dohc, 16v, EGR-cooling,
turbocharging etc.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Other significant additions to the
model include a new transmission known as Dualogic. This is a
Selespeed-like unit, being a manual gearbox controlled by hydraulic
actuators, in turn controlled via a sequential shift with a
fully-automatic mode available. Adual-zone climate control is new in the segment and 
adds to the comfort and ease of use, as do rain and parking sensors.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\npunto2.jpg" alt="Revised 2003 Fiat Punto 3-door" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="272">
Safety has also been taken care of with ESP, MSR and various other
electronic aids being added to the various versions, as well as up to
six airbags being available. Novelties include the "hill-holder" which
keeps the brakes on for 2 seconds if the car is in first gear and a
sensor decides that it is on an incline - designed to make for perfect
hill starts every time....
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">New colours, interior trims and
various changes including the instrumentation and wheels complete a
comprehensive makeover for the best-selling Fiat.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">2005 saw a further revision of the
Punto arrive, affecting only the interiors. Various new interior trims
and colours were introduced, as well as a couple of new exterior
colours. Later that year saw the all newGrande Punto arrive.

<p><b><font color="red" face="Arial" size="+2">Tuning</font></b>
</p><p><img src="logo\greek_punto_rally.jpg" alt="Fiat Punto Abarth Rally" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="365"><font face="Arial">Some
inspiration can be taken from the Punto Rally, developed to run in the
1600 Kit Car class of rallying. Fitted with 215bhp from a 1579cc version
of the 1800 as well as a six speed sequential gearbox and limited slip
diff, a completely built car can be bought from Fiat (with a rather high price).
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">For the normal road car, easily carried out
modifications include installation of a free-flow air filter (a cold air
duct is also a worthy mod) and fitment of a less restrictive exhaust system
to improve the driveability, 'Chips' are also available which (claim to)
increase the power, driveability and torque all at the same time.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The brakes can be improved by fitting drilled
and grooved discs, using a superior pad compound and fitting stainless
steel braided flexible hoses.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Dampers and springs are readily available
for the Punto which will improve the handling, and a strut brace can be
fitted at the front to increase the stiffness of the bodyshell.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">For those wishing for more speed there are a variety of companies offering more radical engine tuning, including a number of 
turbocharging kits which are available.
