<b><font color="red" face="Arial" size="+3">Fiat Stilo</font></b>
<p><img src="logo\stilo_fll_5p.jpg" alt="Fiat Stilo 5-door (2004 restyle)" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="307"><font face="Arial">The
long awaited replacement for theBravo/Brava,
the new 'Stilo' as it has officially been named (internally, project 192),
was released officially at the Geneva Motorshow in March 2001.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Following on from the Bravo/Brava pair, Fiat are
stressing the different characters of the three and five door versions
of the new car. This time, however, there is only the one name for both
models. The heritage of the Bravo can be seen in the design of the three
door car, whilst the five door model retains more styling cues from the
three door version than was the case with the Brava.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The three door car has a slightly shorter body, a
much lower roofline, and the driving position is lower, whilst the five
door car is&nbsp;<img src="logo\stilo_racing.jpg" alt="Fiat Stilo 3-door" align="left" border="1" height="200" width="355">slightly
longer, has a much higher roofline and has a raised drivers seating position.
The latter model is described by the official press release as being a
traditional car with the benefits of a monovolume added, with ease of entry,
excellent interior space and raised driving position being quoted. The
rear seat is also adjustable in two parts. The three door car is claimed
to empahsise driving pleasure, individualism and performance, whilst the
five door concentrates on on-board comfort, interior space (and the implied
safety), versitility and a competitive price. The range comprises three
trim levels (Active, Dynamic and Abarth), the two bodystyles, six engines
(see below) and seventeen different colours.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The engines comprise 4 petrol units and two diesels.
The former start with a 16V 1.2-litre unit (coupled to a six-speed gearbox)
include 1.6 and 1.8-litre 4 cylinder 16V units and conclude with the 2.4-litre
5 cylinder unit (fitted with the Selespeed transmission) with 170bhp in
the Abarth version. The diesels are both 1.9 JTD units, one with 80bhp
and the other with an extra 35bhp thanks to a variable geometry turbocharger
and an intercooler.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The suspension is a conventional MacPherson strut setup at the front and a
modified torsion beam system at the back. Disc brakes are standard all

round on all models, and include Bosch ABS as well as EBD (Electronic Brakeforce
Distribution), ASR (Anti Slip Regulation), MSR (MotorSchleppmomentRegelung)
and a brake assist system. An ESP (Electronic Stability Program) system
is standard on some models. The steering is assisted electrically, proportional
to the speed, and includes two levels of assistance, selectable by the
driver. One is aimed for normal driving, the other (with more assistance)
for town driving and parking. Above 70km/h the two systems coincide.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The interior is aimed to offer class leading levels
of equipment and includes fully adjustable seats and steering wheel, customiseable
central-locking, various displays, trip computer, six-speaker sound system
(with more available as an option), electrically heated and adjustable
door mirrors, adjustable head restraints and various other 'goodies'. An
automatic dual-zone climate control system with an air quality sensor (controlling
recirculation) is optional as are electrically adjustable seats (with a
memory), cruise control (standard on the Abarth), improved sound systems,
CONNECT integrated communications and navigation system, steering wheel

controls, rain sensor, automatic headlights, parking sensor, radar cruise
control, remote control central locking, completely keyless entry and start
system, segmented glass sunroof and more.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Occupant safety
has been concentrated on, both in the design of the structure and in
the provision of six airbags as standard (two front, two side and two
window bags with two sidebags in the rear optional), height adjustable
front seatblets with pretensioners, adjustable head restraints, side
intrusion bars, fire protection system and more.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Other novel features include the now
established
'follow-me-home' headlights (first seen on the Punto) and the new
'puddle-lights'
which illuminate the ground beneath the front doors when the doors are
opened ! The Paris Motorshow of 2002 saw the release of the Stilo MultiWagon.
The estate version of the range it retains the same wheelbase, but is
longer and taller than both the 3 and 5 door versions. As well as the
cavernous loadbay, the interior is designed to be flexible and has many
seating combinations.
A revised rear suspension ensures minimum intrusion giving a wide, low
area, whilst touches like the separately opening rear window make life
with the car much easier.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\stilo_schum.jpg" alt="Fiat Stilo Schumacher (UK spec)" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="308">2004
saw a mild revision to the range with various content, trim, material
and colour changes. Significant design changes concerned only the rear
of the 5-door, which was noticeably improved by the redesign of the
light clusters. Mechanically, a new 1.4 16v engine with 95bhp replaced
the 1.2 16v unit, whilst the 2.4 Abarth became available with a manual
transmission as well as the Selespeed as offered before. Around this
time the new MultiJet diesel units became available, with various
variants of the 1900 turbodiesel being introdued, from 100 to 150bhp,
the latter also with 16 valves. In South America the Stilo also used a
different 1.8-litre engine, a sohc 8v unit with a capacity of 1796cc
and a power output of 105bhp.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Various special editions were built,
most famously the 'Stilo Schumacher'. This originally was a 2.4-litre
3-door only available in a special colour, Ferrari red, but various
markets used various engines and indeed in some countries also
five-door variants were produced (and other colours !).
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">There is also a competition version, built for a single make rally championship, the Stilo Abarth Rally.
