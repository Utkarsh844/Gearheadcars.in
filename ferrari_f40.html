<font face="Arial">Designed to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of Ferrari, the F40 was
duly revealed to the world at the Frankfurt Motorshow in September 1987. It was designed and engineered
to be the nearest thing to a race car on the road, and offered a performance
to match its heritage.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The engine and chassis were (very) loosely
based on those of the 288GTO. The former was
a 2936cc development of the V8, still with four valves per cylinder and
twin IHI turbos, but now generating 478bhp. The compression ratio was a
modest 7.8:1 but the boost pressure used was a less than modest 16psi.
The chassis retained the wheelbase and basic suspension arrangement, double wishbones front and rear, of
the 288GTO but featured wider tracks front and rear. The wheels were immense
17 inch Cromodara units, 13 inches wide at the rear and shed with 335/35
Pirelli P-Zero tyres (8 in at the front with 245/40). Due to the extremely
small ground clearance on some cars the suspension featured a switchable
height control.

The body which hid the tubular steel frame was a completely new design, as
usual by Pininfarina. Using carbon-fibre, kevlar, aluminium and honeycomb
parts it was aerodynamic, functional and light . These aims were further
aided by the use of plastic for all the windows bar the windscreen, early
cars with fixed side windows and later ones with manually wound items.
Numerous ducts and vents were provided to cool the brakes and engine, and
feed the turbos, as well as keep the car on the road, the latter also being
helped by the large rear aerofoil. It was assembled by hand, the resulting
quality of the construction being one of the few (or only!) areas of the
car which was sometimes criticised.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Few compromises were made, with no
power steering and pull-cords to open the door from the inside,
everything was done to keep it light. </font></p><p><font face="Arial">Initial plans to build just 400 were modified
several times, until a total of 1,315 cars had been built.
