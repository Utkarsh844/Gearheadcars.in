<font face="Arial">Launched in the spring of 1989, the Dedra was developed alongside the Fiat Tempra
on the Tipo
floorpan as a medium size three-box saloon.
The design, by the IDEA studio, of the four door body produced an
excellent
drag coefficient of only 0.29. The core of the product was prestige,
exclusivity, personality and comfort, achieved through a high level of
equipment and use of materials (eg Alcantara) as well as details such
as special paints, alloy wheels etc and an attention to soundproofing,
ventilation and other issues. Inside the ability to obtain the perfect
driving position was helped by the adjustable seats, steering wheel,
electrically adjustable mirrors etc. Safety, both passive with a
structure designed to minimise injury in an accident, and active, such
as ABS, was also near the top of the Dedra's agenda.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">Petrol engines initially offered at launch were a
1581cc sohc (90bhp) and a 1995cc dohc (120bhp), both being fitted with
fuel injection whilst the latter also had twin
contra-rotating balancer shafts in the block. These were flanked by a
1929cc turbodiesel (90bhp). Shortly afterwards, in October 1989, a
1756cc dohc (110bhp) petrol unit was added.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">In 1990 two further models were added to
the range - the 'Dedra 2000 turbo' which used a 1995cc turbocharged
dohc
engine producing 165bhp, and the 'Dedra Integrale' which had four wheel
drive and a similar engine slightly more tuned to produce 180bhp. These
models were also fitted with slightly different external trim, bumpers,
fog lights and spoilers. Combining comfort and performance these cars
continued the best of the Lancia tradition. Further additions came in
the shape of an eco 1.9 turbo diesel later in 1990 and then in 1992 a
four-speed automatic transmission, available with the 2.0ie engine.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial"><img src="logo\dedra04x.jpg" alt="Lancia Dedra" width="360" align="left" border="1" height="200">The
range was rationalised and further improved in 1992 with the
introduction of four trim levels, the Comfort, LE, LS and HF. These
grouped the most commonly requested options together, along with some
new fabrics and interior colours. Seat and seatbelt mounting points
were modified, some instruments added and other minor changes (tinted
glass, badging) made. By late 1992 around 264,000 Dedra's had been
sold.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">An all new model, an estate called the Dedra SW (for
Station Wagon), was introduced
in 1994. The engines were the same as the saloon, which were revised to
include a 90bhp multi-point fuel injected 1600 (previously it had been
a single-point
fuel injection unit), and a 16v version of the 2000 engine (139bhp).
The
latter replaced the 2000 turbo which was dropped from the range. With
the discontinuation of the four wheel drive saloon the options were 1.6
and 1.8 in both saloon and estate body, 2.0 auto saloon, 2.0 16v saloon
and estate, 2.0 16v integrale estate and turbodiesel saloon and estate.
Trim levels became three, LE, LS and LX. Again trims changed as did a
variety of other details.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial">The engines were again revised in 1996
when two new 1800 engines were introduced. Actually 1747cc, these produced
113bhp in the normal version, and 130bhp with variable valve timing. Finally
in 1998 the 1600 unit gained 16v (103bhp) just before production of the
Dedra stopped in 1999 when it was replaced by the Lybra.</font>

<p><b><font size="+2" color="red" face="Arial">Tuning</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><font face="Arial">There are three main areas to concentrate
on, the engine (and transmission), the brakes and the suspension and then
various other details. These three should be done together since they complement
each other, not all of one and none of another !</font>
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial">1. The engine.</font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Before modifying the engine it is worthwhile
filling it with a good quality synthetic oil and fitting new spark plugs.
An engine oil additive may also be used.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">The first improvements are relatively simple.
The air filter can be replaced for an aftermarket item which will help
the engine breathe more freely, the type which completely replace the original
airbox are best, and the exhaust can be replaced for one which will restrict
the exit of the gases less. The whole system should be replaced, not just
the rear section.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\dedra03x.jpg" alt="Lancia Dedra" width="443" align="left" border="1" height="200">The
most effective modification (short of engine rebuilds!) is probably to
replace the electronic control unit (or 'chip'). A variety of these are
available, but all should increase the power and improve the driveability.
The downside is that these usually cancel the warranty and may affect the
durability of the engine, the emissions and the fuel consumption. If one
is not available for your specific model it is possible to buy a general
one for any car and program it.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">On turbocharged models the boost pressure
can be raised to increase the power, not too far or the fuelling will not
be able to cope and the engine will run weak. Water spray on the intercooler
is also worth considering, switched by either an air temperature sensor
(the ideal solution) or bay a MAP sensor (the easy solution). Consider
also adding an octane boosting product to the fuel on cars with increased
boost levels, it will help the ignition cope.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Other things to do should include fitting
a cold air intake, a large diameter pipe (minimum 5cm) to provide air from
outside the engine bay to the air filter. The exhaust manifold can also
be lagged with thermal cloth or tape to keep the exhaust gases hotter (and
thus reduce back pressure) and also to keep the underbonnet (and hence
intake and fuel) temperatures lower.
<br>The high tension leads can also be replaced
with performance ones.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Further modifications require the machining
of the cylinder headand/or cylinder block (which will not be dealt with
here since it is not normally a DIY job) after which it may be worth fitting
an oil cooler. If overheating is a problem due to the increased power output
then a small hole can also be drilled through the plate in the thermostat.
There are a multitude of company's with experience of internal cylinder
head modifications for the Lancia twin cam engine so it should be possible
to find one wherever you are.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Regarding the transmission the main requirement
is to uprate the clutch to handle the increase in power and torque achieved
though the engine modifications. Friction plates can be purchased with
improved materials and heavier duty pressure plates are also available.
Whilst doing this it is worthwhile lightening the flywheel.</font>
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial">2. The brakes.</font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Initially it is relatively easy to replace
the brake discs with drilled and grooved items, and the pads for a harder
compound. The latter should not be too hard (ie no race pads on the road)
or they will not function effectively at the normal 'road' operating temperatures.
Stainless steel braided flexible hoses will improve the pedal feel and
reduce the chance of damage whilst DoT5 fluid (not silicon) will increase
the temperature at which it can operate effectively. If the brakes are
getting too hot the dustguards can be removed and/or ducts fitted, taking
air from behind the front bumper.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">If more serious braking is required the
next modification would be to increase the disc size. It is possible to
use larger discs with a bracket allowing use of the production callipers,
or alloy four pot callipers can be fitted.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">In order to improve the balance of the
car under braking it is desireable to be able to adjust the balance of
braking from front to rear (and vice versa). This can be accomplished by
fitting a bias valve in the line to the rear brakes, usually in a position
so that it can be reached from the drivers seat.</font>
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial">3. The suspension.</font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">The easiest improvement,and the one which
will probably bring the single most noticeable change, is to replace the
dampers and&nbsp;<img src="logo\dedra05x.jpg" alt="Lancia Dedra" width="388" align="right" border="1" height="200">springs.
Fitting lowered springs will improve the cornering, but must be fitted
together with shortened throw dampers, or else the springs may unseat !
Top adjustable dampers are compromised, but are good for road and track
day cars since it allows the suspension to be adjusted between these two,
rather different, requirements. Coil over units add more adjustability
and can be purchased outright, or can be made from standard dampers by
welding a threaded sleeve to the standard tube.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">There are then two other main suspension
aims; to reduce the flexiblity in the suspension and to increase the stiffness
of the car, both of which aim at more accurate control of the wheel movement.
To reduce the flexibility it is possible to fit nylon bushes instead of
the normal production rubber items, or if perfection is desired the suspension
can be fitted with metallic bearings (rose joints / rod ends). Spherical
bearing top mounts can also be used. To stiffen the car it is most popular
to fit strut braces. These can be fitted to the front and rear. For more
extreme cases a rollcage can be fitted.....
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Into this category also fall the choice
of wheels and tyres. With an increase in power it can be necessary to fit
larger tyres (thus requiring larger wheels) but the temptation to fit the
biggest possible should be resisted. Consideration should be given to fitting
a wider tyre on the front (since they provide traction and steering) but
keeping the standard, or a wider but not as wide as the front, tyre at
the rear. This will improve the balance of the car. On the four wheel drive
models the same size all around can be the best solution.</font>
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial">4. other things.</font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Other modifications worth considering include
fitment of a shift light (and rev limiter if there is not one as standard),
higher power bulbs in the headlights (if you are going to go faster you
need to see further) and installation of a quicker steering rack.</font>
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<p><b><font size="+2" color="red" face="Arial">Buying / Selling</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial"><b>Some tips to do before selling :</b>
(they may seem obvious, but most people don't do them and thus are in a
weaker bargaining position)
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Tidy inside the car thoroughly : hoover
the floor, empty all pockets, ashtrays (wash), glove compartment etc...,
wipe the trim with a damp cloth, give the cockpit a good airing to get
rid of any odours ! Reset the trip meter to 00000 - it is a pleasant (subconcious)&nbsp;
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\dedra06x.jpg" alt="Lancia Dedra" width="423" align="left" border="1" height="200">surprise.
If the car has been standing give it a
good run - this will clear out the engine (reduce exhaust smoke), put a
shine on the brake discs and loosen up any joints that may otherwise make some noises.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">'Back to black' products are very effective
at temporarily restoring bumpers and trim. This makes a big difference
to any car. Do it a week before you expect people to view the car, otherwise
it may be a bit too obvious !
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Jetwash under the car, especially under
the engine and in the wheelarches. The prospective buyer may be an enthusiast,
and this makes it easier for them to see what they want to check.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Obviously wash the car and clean the windows !
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><b>If you are going to buy a car always
check the following :</b>
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Firstly check the bodywork. Check that
there are no mismatching panels, large areas of discolouration or signs
of fresh paint (compare inside the engine bay with the external body colour),
all of which probably indicate accident damage.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Check the main electrical functions - wipers,
windows, lights, etc... try putting the main beam and wipers on at the
same time. Check the headlights for cracks.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Check the brake pedal does not go to the
floor if pressed hard for a long time and check the gearchange for clean engagement.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial">The engine should be run up to temperature,
check the exhaust for smoke (especially on turbo models), the condition
of the breather (look for mayonnaise), the condition of the oil filler cap
(again white deposits can indicate head gasket or other serious problems
or the use of the car only on short journeys, another bad state of affairs)
and the colour of the coolant (preferably not thick or dark brown!). Listen
to the noise of the engine, then depress the clutch and engage first gear.
Whatever noise has disappeared was coming form the gearbox, what remains
is from the engine. Also check the condition of the engine oil on the dipstick.The
lighter brown the better, if it is thick black then leave quickly.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Check tyre wear, uneven patterns could
imply a bent chassis.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Always take it for a test drive. Check
that the car tracks in a straight line with no steering input and also
remains straight under braking. Find a large open area and complete several
lock to lock turns (also in reverse), listening for any noises. Try the
handbrake when moving - seized rear callipers will mean uneven braking or no braking.</font>
