The first ever Ferrari with a front mounted V8, the California is also
the first Ferrari to have the now-popular folding metal roof. The
official pre-launch press release from early 2008 read as follows :
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>"

NEW FERRARI CALIFORNIA REVEALED: A HUGELY VERSATILE, INNOVATION-PACKED GT
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>The Ferrari California joins the Prancing Horse&#8217;s 8-cylinder family which has always
been defined by power and performance. It also flanks the flagship 612 Scaglietti in the
prestige sporty Grand Tourer segment.
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>The new Ferrari California will satisfy even the most demanding of owners in term of its
superb vehicle dynamics and driving pleasure. The new model will be available
exclusively as a convertible with a folding hard top. Both chassis and bodywork are
aluminium, in line with the rest of the current range. The California will be powered by
a new V8 engine mounted for the first time in the marque&#8217;s history in the mid-front
position.
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i><img src="logo\california_2.jpg" alt="Ferrari California" width="413" align="left" border="1" height="200">
In line with Ferrari tradition, the new model also features several innovations. Apart
from its folding hard top, these include the original 2+ concept which guarantees
exceptional versatility of use in the rear of the car. The California&#8217;s 4,300 cc V8 engine
features direct fuel injection and a &#8220;flat&#8221; crankshaft. It generates 460 CV at 7,500 rpm
with a torque curve that enhances vehicle dynamics and provides maximum driving
pleasure which is typical for Ferrari.
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>As per the traditional Ferrari transaxle layout, the engine, which allows the Ferrari
California to sprint from 0 to 100 km/h in less than 4.0 seconds, will be coupled to a
7-speed dual clutch transmission that boosts the car&#8217;s performance while enhancing the
driving pleasure, improves ride comfort and reduces fuel consumption and emissions
(c.310 g/km CO2). The comfort is further enhanced by a new multilink rear suspension
system. The Ferrari California is also equipped with the exclusive F1-Trac traction

control system which made its debut on the 599 GTB Fiorano and has been further
honed to suit the typical driving conditions expected for this new GT. Brembo brakes
featuring carbon-ceramic material disks as standard guarantee superbly efficient
braking.
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>In addition to sporting the marque&#8217;s classic styling cues, the cabin has also been
beautifully trimmed using quality materials by Ferrari&#8217;s own skilled artisans. New
accessories and equipment, such as the seats, steering wheel, instrument panel and
infotainment system, together with optimised aerodynamics ensure that this is a highly
ergonomic and enjoyable car to drive regardless of whether the top is up or down.
The Ferrari California is aimed at owners who desire a car which embodies everything
the Prancing Horse represents in terms of sporty design and innovation, but also seek a
car with greater versatility than ever
