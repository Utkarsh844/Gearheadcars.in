<font face="Arial">Designed to replace the 037, the Delta S4 followed
Audi and Peugeot in the move to four wheel drive. The program began in 1983 and the first prototype was ready in June
1984. Starting from a clean sheet of paper, with all the experience of the 037 and Stratos, a tubular space frame
chassis was adopted, the bare frame
weighing under 100kg. The composite (Nomex, carbon-fibre and Kevlar)
body panels are bonded to the steel structure to add to its rigidity.
The entire front and rear bodywork sections are hinged for easy access.
The whole exterior design is dominated by the numerous air intakes,
those on the roof cool the engine bay and oil cooler, the lateral ones
feed the intercoolers whilst the intake at the base of the windscreen
ducts air back (through the sills) to cool the exhaust system.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The suspension was broadly based on the successful layout used on the 037, with double wishbones front and rear and with a 
number of adjustable pick-up points.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The biggest novelty for the car was the all new drivetrain
with a four wheel drive system with three differentials. The gearbox
was mounted centrally, ahead of the engine and a spur gear set
transmits the power from the gearbox to the centre diff. From this
propshafts carry the power to the front and rear differentials.
In the centre diff there was a Ferguson type viscous coupling, whilst
mechanical self-locking types were fitted at the front and rear. The
drive torque split was adjustable, the road cars had 30% front and 70%
rear. </font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\s4_studio.jpg" alt="Lancia Delta S4" width="331" align="left" border="1" height="200">
An all new engine was designed by Abarth. This had a capacity of
1759cc, used
an alloy cylinder head and cylinder block, had four valves per
cylinder,
twin overhead camshafts, fuel injection (with two injectors per
cylinder)
and most interestingly both a turbocharger and a supercharger with twin
air-to-air intercoolers. A power of 480bhp was produced at 8400rpm. The
unusual route of using a supercharger and turbocharger together was to
avoid the poor performance of the large turbochargers at low engine
speeds. On the S4 the order, from the air intake was turbocharger,
intercooler, supercharger, intercooler, inlet manifoldschematic diagram. 
Once the supercharger became less efficient, at higher engine speeds where the turbo performed better, a bypass 
allowed the turbo to feed the engine directly.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The road cars had a declared top speed
of 225km/h, took 6 seconds to get to 100km/h, and completed the
standing km in 25.6 seconds.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The S4 was homologated on 1st November
1985 and made it's World Championship debut on the RAC in that same month
where it finished first and second. It continued to score several victories
in 1986 but was beaten to the championship by Peugeot. After the tragic
death of Toivonen and Cresto in the Tour de Corse of that year Group B
was banned, and thus the S4 ended it's career somewhat prematurely. It was followed by the all dominating HF 4WD &amp; integrale.
