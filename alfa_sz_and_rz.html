<font face="Arial">The Geneva Motorshow in 1989 saw the appearance of a new and controversially
styled Alfa Romeo, the SZ (or ES30). Designed in-house by Alfa Romeo, it
was effectively a heavily tuned chassis and mechanicals
with a new bodyshell. Production was carried out by Zagato, where 1000
cars were built. The RZ (a cabriolet) was a pure Zagato project, and only
about 241 examples were produced. The latter shared few panels with the
SZ and was some 100kgs heavier due to the strengthening required.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The 3 litre (2959cc) V6 engine from
the
75 was tuned to give a total of 210bhp whilst the suspension was
modified
to cope with the extra performance. The torsion bars were replaced by
coil
over units, and uniball joints replaced all the rubber. A hydraulic
system
which can be controlled from the cockpit can vary the ride height of
the
car (supposedly included to aid the crossing of speed-bumps and the
like). The brakes were also taken from the 75, from the Turbo
Evoluzione
model. Other mechanical parts such as the final drive were modified 75
items.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The bodywork was developed extensively
in the windtunnel, with a final drag coefficient of 0.30 as well as very
low lift. All the body panels were made (using injection moulding) from
a composite material ('Modar' resin plus glass fibre) with the exception
of the roof (which was aluminium) and the tailgate spoiler (which was carbon
fibre). These panels were then bonded to the steel structure which retained
the 75 wheelbase.</font>

<p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Arial" size="+2">Buying / Selling</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">Check the chassis number and identification
carefully for authenticity. These are collectors cars and so even any minor
detail changes from the standard will probably affect the value of the car.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Check the bodywork. Check that there are
no mismatching panels, large areas of discolouration or signs of fresh
paint (compare&nbsp;<img src="logo\szcockpit_200.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo SZ cockpit" align="left" border="1" height="200" width="300">inside
the engine bay with the external body colour), all of which probably indicate accident damage.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Check the main electrical functions - wipers,
windows, lights, etc... try putting the main beam and wipers on at the
same time. Check the headlights for cracks and ensure that the air conditioning
system is functioning correctly.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Check the brake pedal does not go to the
floor if pressed hard for a long time and if possible check the brake discs
for wear (through the wheels at the front). Check the gearchange for clean
engagement, the gear linkage can become sloppy when worn, but these can be replaced.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The engine should be run up to temperature,
check the exhaust for smoke, the condition of the breather (look for mayonaise),
the condition of the oil filler cap (again white deposits can indicate head
gasket or other serious problems) and the colour of the coolant (preferably
not thick or dark brown!). Check the oil pressure, it should be around
3.5 bar when driving and not drop below 0.5 bar at idle.Listen to the noise
of the engine, then depress the clutch and engage first gear. Whatever
noise has disappeared was coming from the gearbox, what remains is from
the engine. Also check the condition of the engine oil on the dipstick.The
lighter brown the better, if it is thick black then leave quickly.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\sz1_200.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo SZ" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="356">
Try to find out when the timing belts were last changed. If not recently then
have them changed - the official interval is 48,000 miles.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Check tyre wear, uneven patterns could imply a bent chassis.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Always take it for a test drive. Check
that the car tracks in a straight line with no steering input and also
remains straight under braking. Find a large open area and complete several
lock to lock turns (also in reverse), listening for any noises. Try the
handbrake when moving - seized rear callipers will mean uneven braking or no braking.</font>
