<p><img src="logo\coupefiat2.jpg" alt="Coupé Fiat" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="342"><font face="Arial">The
Fiat Coupé, based on the Tipo platform, entered
production in 1993. Power came from either an 1995cc 16V (142bhp) or a
1995cc 16V turbo (195bhp) engine (both developed from engines taken from
the Lancia range, the latter from the Integrale). In 1996 the 1747cc 16V
(130bhp) engine from the Barchetta was transplanted into the Coupé, and
then in 1997 both 2 litre units were replaced by the new 5 cylinder 1998cc
engines, both with (220bhp) and without (147bhp) a turbo.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">An all new body was designed in-house by
Fiat, although production of the car was given to Pininfarina due to the
low volumes. The two door coupé body still allows normal useage of the rear
seats and contains many interesting styling touches such as the door handles
high in the b-pillar to keep the doors clean, the faired headlights, motorcycle
style filling cap, strip of body coloured metal across the dashboard, etc...
Maintaining this theme, Fiat introduced a push button starter switch on
some later models.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">To cope with the performance of the five cylinder turbo engine (220bhp and
310Nm) that variant also comes fitted as standard with a limited slip differential
(called Viscodrive) and four pot Brembo brake callipers. In 1998 a 
20v turbo Limited Edition
saw the introduction of a six
speed gearbox (which also became optional on other turbo cars) as well
as a bodykit and various details. In 1999 the six speed box became
standard on the
turbocharged model.

<font face="Arial">Easily carried out modifications include installation of a free-flow air filter
(a cold air duct is also a worthy mod) and fitment of a less restrictive
exhaust system to improve the driveability, 'Chips' are also available
which (claim to) increase the power, driveability and torque all at the same time.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The brakes can be improved by fitting drilled
and grooved discs, using a superior pad compound and fitting stainless
steel braided flexible hoses. Numerous aftermarket conversions are available to further improve the stopping power of the Coupé.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Dampers and springs are readily available
for the Coupé which will improve the handling, and a strut brace can be
fitted at the front to increase the stiffness of the bodyshell.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Due to the commonality of many of the parts there is a wealth of tuning information and knowledge around, 
the four-pot 2-litre unit being the same at the integrale etc. This can be well used when preparing a Coupé.</font>

the 1.8-litre engine was 183 and the 16V 2.0-litre n/a engine was the
type 836. The 5-cylinder 20V engines were all type 182 with various
