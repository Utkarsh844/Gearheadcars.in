<b><font color="red" face="Arial" size="+3">Fiat in motorsport</font></b><br/>
<font face="Arial">Fiat has an outstanding record in motorsport from
the beginning up to the present day, including three World Rally
Championship titles.
</font><p><font face="Arial">It's involvement in motorsport began in
1900, the year after it was founded, when Lancia drove to victory at Padua, with a car based on the 6HP. 
1901/2 saw a competition version of the 12HP emerge, whilst later in 1902 the first car 
developed specifically for motorsport was born, the 7.2-litre, 4-cylinder 24HP Corsa.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Significant involvement in competition
continued in a variety of events and in 1903 Fiat entered the
Paris-Madrid race, signalling it's first foray into international
motorsport. At that time cars were developing rapidly, and the
comptition cars from Fiat were no different. 1903 saw the arrival of
the 60HP Corsa. With its 10.6-litre 4-cylinder engine, it won its class
in the Targa Florio of that year, the Reedville meeting in the USA in
the following year, and the GP of France in 1911. Development continued
apace, with the 14-litre 75HP Corsa in 1904, the 16.2-litre (still
4-cylinders) 100HP Corsa in 1905 and the derivative 110HP Corsa which
dominated the Gordon Bennett race in 1905.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">1907 saw Fiat take victory in the Targa Florio, the Kaiserpreis and the
French GP. Involvement in the latter part of the decade concentrated more
in the US where some victories were obtained, although in Europe Fiat's
continued to win occasional events.


</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Between the wars the various 508 and
Balilla cars, including the unusual aerodynamic versions, continued to
compete in a variety of events, mainly road based. Moving on, the 8 V was really only built as a technology demonstrator, but did well in sport, 
especially the lighter Zagato bodied versions. In the fifties and sixties the name associated with Fiat and motorsport 
was Abarth which produced immensely successful models based on the 500, 600 and 
850 to name but a few.

Modern rallying involvement by Fiat themselves began in the late 1960s with the 125 and 124
cars. 1970 saw Fiat establish a competitions department, whilst 1971
was the first year that Fiat officially entered their own team. Top
five finishes were recorded in that first year, with their first
championship rally victory coming in Greece in 1972.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The world of rallying changed in 1973
with the inauguration of the World Rally Championship for Constructors.
Wins continued in that year and through 1974 and 1975, but the Lancia Stratos
proved invincible and took the title in both those years. 1976 saw a
reduced effort as Lancia was given the task to represent the group in
rallying. In the following year, the mantle moved to Fiat with the
newly developed 131 Abarth.
This proved more than successful and won the constructors title in 1977
and then again in 1978. The effort was reduced in 1979 with only a few
events contested, but with a full-on attack in 1980 a third world
championship title was won by Fiat, still using the 131 Abarth. </font></p><p><font face="Arial">After this point the effort was
reduced in 1981 and ceased completely after this time. Lancia returned
to rallying in 1982 with the 037, and in 
the following years, with the S4 then Delta integrale made history for the group using the Lancia brand.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Fiats involvement in rallying then
became limited to producing cars mainly for junior drivers to start
their careers in, organising one-make championships for such people.
This started with the Uno turbo and was followed by the Cinquecento and Seicento rally cars.

The Punto
saw a return to the development of more serious machinery, albeit for
sale to customers, and not for entry as a Fiat team. First under the
&#8216;Kit&#8217; regulations and now the Super 1600 rules, the Punto has proven a
very successful competitor, taking the Italian Rally Championship in
2003. The Stilo
continues the trend to develop competent cars for young drivers on
tight budgets. Built to internationally recognised specifications, it
enables young drivers to show their capabilities in equal machinery
without requiring huge budgets.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The Grande Punto
was also developed to compete in international rallying, under the
Super-2000 regulations. It made its debut on the Rally del Ciocco, a
round of the Italian Rally Championship, in March 2006. In that, its
debut year, it won not just the Italian Rally Championship (driven by
Andreucci) but also the FIA European Rally Championship (driven by
Basso) and the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (also Basso).
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">2007 saw the same car competing under the relaunched Abarth
brand name in the IRC, Italian and European Championships as well as in
a number of other national championships around Europe. In that year it
again won the Italian Rally Championship, and took the runners up spot
in the IRC as well as several excellent positions in the European
Championship. It also made an appearance at the 2007 Race of Champions,
driven by various drivers including Michael Schumacher.
