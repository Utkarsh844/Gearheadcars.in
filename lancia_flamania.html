<p><img src="logo\flaminiagt_200.jpg" alt="Lancia Flaminia GT" width="233" align="right" border="1" height="200"><font face="Arial">To
replace the Aurelia, Lancia developed the Flaminia,
first shown as a prototype at the 1956 Turin Motorshow. The production
car emerged the following year at the Geneva Show. The basic chassis was
an evolution of the Aurelia unit, shortened by some 80mm, coupled with
an all new engine, still a 60º V6 but now displacing 2458cc and producing
102bhp. Pininfarina were contracted for the styling, which was to follow
their earlier concept cars, the Floride series, also based on an Aurelia
chassis. Significant differences from the previous model included the front
suspension which adopted unequal length wishbones with coil springs whilst
a de Dion setup was used at the rear. As on the Aurelia, the clutch and
gearbox were situated at the rear whilst the former car's drum brakes were
substituted by discs after the first 500 Flaminias had left the production line.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">In 1961 the engine gained 8bhp thanks to a different
carburettor, but sales were poor, a situation which continued to deteriorate,
despite the arrival of an increased capacity engine in 1962. This was a
2775cc unit which produced 125bhp, a figure still relatively modest given
the weight of the car, a generous 1490kg. Production continued until 1970,
but only 599 of the bigger engined cars were sold by then. A total of around
3349 smaller engined saloons were built, production ceasing in 1963.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Four principle variants were built, coupés
by Pininfarina, Touring and Zagato and an open-topped version by Touring.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Pininfarina produced the Coupe with a wheelbase shortened
by 120mm and an engine producing 119bhp. This was a two-door four-seater
with styling heavily based on that of the Floride II.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Carrozzeria Touring produced the GT with a wheelbase
shortened by 350mm (from that of the berlina) and the same 119bhp engine
as the Coupé. This was strictly a two seater and utilised much aluminium
in the bodywork to reduce the weight.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\flaminiasport_200.jpg" alt="Lancia Flaminia Sport" width="363" align="left" border="1" height="200">Zagato
produced the Sport, released in 1958, another two seater with an all aluminium
body and the 119bhp engine.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Pininfarina also produced four Presidenziale cars
in 1960 for use by the Italian government during state visits. These has
a wheelbase stretched by 480mm.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Carrozzeria Touring also produced the Convertibile
which was a GT without the roof, a hard top being optional.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">When the 110bhp engine was released in 1961, a version
for the Police was developed using triple carburettors which generated
140bhp. This engine then became available in the GT, Convertible and Sport models.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\flaminia.jpg" alt="Lancia Flaminia" width="359" align="right" border="1" height="200">The
Coupe also received a boost in 1962 when it gained a single triple-barrel
carburettor which gave it 128bhp. That year also saw the addition to the
Touring products of the GTL, a 2+2 version of the GT with a 80mm longer wheelbase.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The revised 2.8-litre engine was also tuned for use
in the various variants, giving 136bhp in the Coupé and 150bhp in
the Sport, Convertibile, GT and GTL.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">1964 saw the cessation of production of the Convertible
and Sport, the latter being replaced by the Super Sport 2.8 3C which, with
its 152bhp engine, continued in production until 1967, as did the Coupe.
In the meantime the GT and GTL ceased being built in 1965.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Approximate production figures are :
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Berlina : 2,5-litre : 3349 ; 2.8-litre : 599
<br>Coupé : 5284
<br>GT &amp; GTL : 2016
