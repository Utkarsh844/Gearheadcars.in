The Fiat Linea is a three-volume, C-segment saloon which made its world
début at the Istanbul Motor Show in November 2006. Produced in
collaboration with Tofas, the Turkish joint venture between Fiat Auto
and Koç Holding, it is manufactured in the joint venture&#8217;s Bursa plant
in Turkey (at an annual production of 60,000 units) and marketed in a
number of European and non-European countries since 2007. There are
plans to also produce the Fiat Linea in China and Brazil.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Designed internally by the Fiat Centro Stile in Turin, the Fiat Linea is based heavily on the underpinnings of the Grande Punto
and is effectively a long-wheelbase three-volume version of that car.
The deisgners, however, have succeeded in producing an exceptionally
well balanced and proportioned design. The interior is also similar in
styling to the Grande Punto, but offers considerably more room both at
the front and in the rear. This is obviously enhanced by a huge 500
litre luggage compartment.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\linea002.jpg" alt="New Fiat Linea" align="left" border="1" height="200" width="346">Mechanically
the Linea carries across the conventional Grande Punto layout with a
front mounted transverse engine driving the front wheels. A variety of
engines will be fitted to the car depending on the market, in Europe
the 1.4 8v FIRE unit with 77bhp and 1.3 16v MultiJet turbodiesel with
90bhp are the two launch engines, followed shortly afterwards by the
1.4 16v TJet turbocharged FIRE with 120bhp. In Brazil a multi-fuel
1.9-litre engine will be used. Transmissions are manual plus the option
of Fiat's Dualogic robotised manual (clutchless) transmission.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">As with all new cars, safety also
plays a significant role in the design of the Linea. Passive safety
includes up to six airbags, with the two front ones being multi-stage,
as well as seatbelts with pre-tensioners, load limiters, head
restraints and ISOFIX attachments. Active safety includes ESP
(stability programme), ASR (traction control) and MSR (braking torque
control).
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Although the actual specifications of
the cars vary depending upon the market they are being sold in, the
basic range produced by the factory consists of three trim levels,
three corresponding interior trims and eleven body colours.
