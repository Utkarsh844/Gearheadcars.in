<b><font color="#ff0000" face="Arial" size="+3">Alfa Romeo Spider &amp; GTV</font></b>
<p><img src="logo\gtv_press.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo GTV" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="354"><font face="Arial">The
GTV coupe and Spider convertible were launched at the Geneva Motorshow in March 1995, after a long period
where Alfa Romeo had no real sporting models in its range. Really the spiritual
successors to the Betone GTV coupés
and the Duetto Spider respectively, both were
designed in-house at Alfa Romeo (with some assistance from Pininfarina).

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The chassis is originally based on the Tipo
platform but is heavily modified with MacPherson strut front and an all
new multilink rear suspension. The latter mounts the suspension onto a
light alloy subframe which in turn is bolted to the car. Through
careful design of geometry and bush compliance a small amount of rear
wheel steer has also been included. This results in exceptional
handling, which has been praised by many journalists, a factor
which is further improved through the use of a very quick steering
rack, with just 2.1 turns lock to lock.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><img src="logo\spider002xx.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo Spider" align="left" border="1" height="200" width="402">
Power came from any of the following;
a 1747cc twin spark 16V (144bhp), a 1970cc twin spark 16V (155bhp), a 1996cc
V6 turbo (200bhp) or a 2959cc V6 (12V with 192bhp or 24V with 220bhp).
The latter was the fastest production Alfa Romeo to date when new.

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The GTV accomodates two (plus two!),
whilst the Spider is strictly for two. The open topped car features a
folding soft-top, with a five hoop frame, which completely disappears
from site under a flush fitting cover. An electric folding mechanism is
fitted on some versions. As would be expected the GTV has
a much more rigid chassis, although considerable work was
(successfully) done to ensure that the Spider does not suffer from
scuttleshake. </font></p><p><font face="Arial">A mid-life update in 1998 is recogniseable
by the addition of a chrome rim around the Alfa shield in the bonnet, whilst
a more significant change was the addition of an (optional) six-speed gearbox
for the 3.0 24V version. Various other details were changed and the cockpit
was slightly redesigned.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">More significantly facelifted versions
of both the Spider and GTV were relased at the Geneva Motorshow 2003.
Both got a much deeper 147-style front grille, whilst the GTV also
gained a significant power boost with the addition of a a 240bhp
3.2-litre 24V V6 engine. A variety of detail modifications were also
carried out to the interior, suspension etc.

<b><font color="#ff0000" face="Arial" size="+2">Monoposto</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial">A one-off prototype for a racing car, the
Monoposto was effectively a modified Spider, fitted with the 3.0 V6
from the GTV. Modified aerodynamics saw (apart from the removale of the
windscreen) a new front and rear bumper, as well as a rigid (albeit
removable) tonneau hiding a rather small passenger seat. Other touches
included a 70's prototype style rear-view mirror and an F1 style in-car
camera. Various options were studied, including producing a kit for
existing Spiders, a limited run for a one-make series and others, but
in the end it remained a single prototype.

<p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Arial" size="+2">Tuning</font></b>
</p><p><img src="logo\gtv_press2.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo GTV" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="239"><font face="Arial">Easily
carried out modifications include installation of a free-flow air filter
(a cold air duct is also a worthy mod) and fitment of a less restrictive
exhaust system to improve the driveability, 'Chips' are also available
which (claim to) increase the power, driveability and torque all at the
same time. There are also companies offering such accessories as traction
control and launch control, and for those desiring yet more power, 3.5
litre conversions.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The brakes can be improved by using a higher specification fluid, fitting drilled
and grooved discs, using a superior pad compound and fitting stainless
steel braided flexible hoses.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Dampers and springs are readily available
for the Spider and GTV which will improve the handling, and a strut brace
can be fitted at the front to increase the stiffness of the bodyshell. The rubber 
bushes can also be replaced by items made from less compliant material.</font>

</p><p><img src="logo\spider_cockpit.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo Spider cockpit" align="right" border="1" height="200" width="283"><font face="Arial">Try
your nearest Alfa Romeo dealer....
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">As well as all the normal checks, look
particularly at the following :
</font></p><p><font face="Arial">1. Uneven tyre wear at the front (especially
inner the edges) which usually indicates that the tracking will need readjusting
(relatively inexpensive).
<br>2. Uneven tyre wear at the rear (accompanied
by a knocking noise) can indicate loose suspension bolts (rear link).
<br>3. Correct funtioning of the air-conditioning (if fitted).
<br>4. Ensure you get the brown 'master' key
in case you lose the others.</font>
