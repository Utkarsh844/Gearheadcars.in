The Geneva Motorshow in 2007 saw the long awaited revealing of the new
Lancia Delta. Many years after the highly successful original Delta and it slightly less
successful successor , the new car represented a major step forward for Lancia, being the first significant new product for many 
years. The official press release at the launch read as follows :

</font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>Delta is a historical name
associated with a peak in Lancia&#8217;s motoring past but it is also a
mathematical symbol that stands for change, difference and evolution.
From this viewpoint, the Lancia Delta is the first product of the new
Lancia philosophy. It has an original, unique positioning, the
combination of two values that are fundamental for the brand, elegant
styling and a daring, innovative attitude, that inspires all aspects of
its marketing and communications activities.
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>The first totally new car in
Lancia&#8217;s second century makes its appearance today, with an
unparalleled design that upholds the brand&#8217;s vocation for innovation. A
first evolutionary &#8220;delta&#8221; is Lancia&#8217;s ability to reconcile its
traditional elegance with original architectural solutions which
harmoniously blend the assertiveness of a sports car with the onboard
well-being of a saloon for the first time.
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>Designed by the Lancia Style
Centre, the new Delta carries forward the tradition of the &#8220;great&#8221;
Lancia models of the past &#8211;the Aprilia, the Appia, the Fulvia, the
Beta, the Prisma, the Dedra and the Lybra &#8211; into the future, and takes
its place firmly in the medium saloon segment. The Delta is 4.5 metres
long, 1.8 metres wide and 1.5 metres high, measurements that combine
with a wheelbase of 2.7 metres to guarantee an extraordinary amount of
roominess for this category.
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>The interior is quiet and full
of light, furnished with luxury materials and harmonious colours, and
guarantees unbeatable travelling comfort. The sound-absorbing
headlining keeps noise to a minimum and luminosity is guaranteed by the
extensive glazing of the side windows and the GranLuce sunroof, when it
is fitted.
A sliding rear seat with reclining squab turns the passenger
compartment into an enjoyable living-room. And this solution also makes
the large luggage compartment even more versatile, modular and
capacious.
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>The new Delta offers a high
level of technology in terms of entertainment, thanks to collaboration
with leading partners in each sector, exemplified by a Bose Hi-Fi radio
incorporating a CD player and MP3 file reader with steering-wheel
mounted controls, the Blue&amp;Me® system developed with Microsoft,
also available in a NAV version, and a brand new satellite navigation
system developed with Magneti Marelli.
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>The Lancia Delta also
expresses elegance and attitude where the engines and engineering are
concerned. This attitude comes from fitting a range of turbo engines,
both petrol and diesel, with power deliveries extending from 120 bhp up
to 200 bhp, and a choice of 6-speed transmissions &#8211; manual, robotised
and automatic. Engine performance is backed up by tried and tested
engineering that guarantees comfort and handling thanks to the adoption
of an advanced ESC (Electronic Stability Control) system and technical
features that are unique in this category, such as SDC suspension (with
electronic damping control), which makes the car even more enjoyable to
drive.
</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial"><i>Elegance is conveyed by the
lines and materials, but also by the car&#8217;s relationship with the
outside world. Where the environment is concerned, the Lancia Delta&#8217;s
diesel engines anticipate the limits of the future Euro 5 standards, a
feature that certainly represents another &#8220;delta&#8221; in relation to the
competition.
With such features and the international development work underway to
support the launch, which will take place in mid 2008, the Delta marks
a turning point in Lancia history, and will certainly make a
significant contribution to the implementation of the strategic plan.
</i>

</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Based on the platform of the Fiat Bravo,
this has been stretched to provide a roomier, more luxurious interior.
The mechanical layout is also an evolution of the sister cars',
although Lancia will get some engines and other technology which is not
available in the Fiat. The launch is due in mid-2008.
